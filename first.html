	<p><h1>Kananur Lokesh Rahul</h1> is an Indian international cricketer. He is the current vice-captain of the India national cricket team in all formats. He plays for Karnataka in domestic cricket. He is the current captain of Lucknow Super Giants in the Indian Premier League. He is a right-handed batsman and an occasional wicket-keeper.</p>

	<section>
		<p>Hailing from a background of high academic standards, KL Rahul was born and brought up in the prestigious <i> National Institute of Technology</i>, Karnataka, where his father is a professor in the department of Civil Engineering. He finished his schooling in NITK and grew to develop keen interest in cricket. Having started off with batting on the grass-less field of the college, Rahul's parents spotted a spark in him and decided that he must receive formal training in order to realize his talents.</p>

		<section>The prospect of a debut on a momentous occasion like the Boxing Day at the MCG against the world's chirpiest team seemed to throw Rahul off his game, as he crumbled under pressure and lost his wicket to two shots unbecoming (to say the least) of a Test player. With the series already lost, and in a manifestation of compassion for Rahul's nervous jitters, the selectors and the captain decided to give Rahul a go at his usual opening spot in the Sydney Test. He had a dramatic redemption in Sydney as he stroked his way to a patient century, proving that he belongs in the national side – to himself, more than anyone else. </section>
